# 42-net_practice

You will have to configure small-scale networks. 

To do so, it will be necessary to under- stand how TCP/IP addressing works.

You will have to complete 10 levels (i.e. 10 exercises) and turn them in your Git repository.

NetPractice is a general practical exercise to let you discover networking.

What is NetPractice?
NetPractice is an individual project at 42 that requires us to configure small-scale networks. In a network, devices need to communicate. For this, communication protocols and models were created. Among them, there is the TCP/IP model. TCP/IP is a set of communication protocols. The name comes from two protocols TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and the IP (Internet Protocol). It aims to standardize all network communications, particularly web communications. When configuring TCP/IP settings on a device, a subnet mask must be specified. This mask allows the device to determine which IP addresses are on the local network and which should be reached by a gateway in the device's routing table.
